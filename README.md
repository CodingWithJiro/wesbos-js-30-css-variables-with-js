This project adapts a **[granular branching and commit workflow](https://github.com/CodingWithJiro/wesbos-js-30-css-variables-with-js/network)** to simulate team collaboration. Each feature, fix, documentation, and chore is tracked in its own branch with descriptive commits.

Each **[pull request](https://github.com/CodingWithJiro/wesbos-js-30-css-variables-with-js/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)** I created contains a clear description, change list, screenshots for UI updates, and reviewer notes.

_This ensures I maintain a professional workflow, even as a solo developer._
